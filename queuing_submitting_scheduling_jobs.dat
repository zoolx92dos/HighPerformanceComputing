Overview of how to submit jobs

The submission of an interactive job is shown first and then is translated to a batch job submission. 

qsub - submit PBS job 
qsub -I -A [ACCOUNT-STRING] -l select=1:ncpus=1:mem=5GB -l walltime=1:00:00 

In the above line:  
qsub -I  (qsub minus capital i) indicates that this is an interactive job 
-l (minus little L) indicates a resource request (in front of select and walltime) 
select=1 requests resources on a single compute node 
:ncpus=1 requests a single core on the compute node 
:mem=5GB requests 5GB of memory (ram) for the requested cores on the single node 
walltime=1:00:00 requests 1 hour, 00 minutes and 00 seconds of runtime    

To terminate the interactive job type exit on the command line.      

To submit a batch job open a file and enter these lines: 
#!/bin/bash 
#PBS -A [ACCOUNT-STRING] 
#PBS -N [JOBNAME] 
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=1:mem=5GB 
#PBS -l walltime=1:00:00

If you have named the file test-file then you submit via qsub test-file.
